This repository contains the HTML and CSS code used to create a fake landing page for the Jasmine Dragon tea shop in the Avatar the Last Airbender animated series. The images and font used can be found within the 'Credits' section of the webpage. 

Take a look for yourself!!

P.S. This is my first ever coding project, so it is FAR from being perfect. The knowledge used to build this project comes from Codecademy and YouTube.
